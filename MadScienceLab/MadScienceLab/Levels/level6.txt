Want it so that:
1. bringing 1/3 boxes to middle, the other boxes occupied in order to bring the box to the middle
	(though, this box would have to not require a middle ground box)
2. this leading to not having to have both the other boxes occupied in order to ascend, so can bring another box to middle ground
If I can make walking up but not bringing up a box require a middle ground box ... then could just use 3 boxes.
So, if having a surplus of boxes, ...what could I do with it ...
Maybe make the UR box then have to be used for the DR switch after being available
	-ie. require a switch in side
		-how?
-Or, make the box used for another set of trapdoors. Done.
3.
